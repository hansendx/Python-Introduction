\section{Getting Started}

\subsection{Installing Python}

\subsubsection{Linux}\label{linux_python_install}
Many linux systems have Python already installed.
Older systems might have Python2 alongside Python3.
Refrain from using Python2 since it is not fully compatible with Python3
and reached its end of life with the start of 2020.

On debian based systems Python3 can be installed with apt in the terminal:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
sudo apt-get install python3.8
# Or just 3 if 3.8 is not available for you
sudo apt-get install python3
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Windows 10}
Windows 10 supports running linux inside itself with the
``Windows Subsystem for Linux''.\footnote{\href{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10}{Installation Guide}}
If you choose a debian based subsystem like ubuntu, you can use the
installation command from the section{~}\ref{linux_python_install}.

\subsection{Windows 7}
If still have a Windows 7 installion on yout personal PC you should upgrade to Windows 10.
Windows 7 is no longer save to work in.
If you have to work with a Windows 7 systems on your work station at the DIW you can use conda.
You can get an installer for anaconda \href{https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section}{here}.
Anaconda can be installed without Admin privileges if you only install it for your user.
Install the full anaconda distribution not miniconda.




\subsection{Your Development Environment}

Probably the most popular editors for python developers are
\href{https://code.visualstudio.com/}{Visual Studio Code}
and \href{https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/}{PyCharm}.
PyCharm is specifically geared towards development in Python.
VSCode was created for web development but it also has a wide array of
extensions that allow you to work with other languages.
The Python extension is very mature and actively developed by microsoft.
VSCode is completely open source whereas PyCharm is partially open source, with
a free and a commercial version.

\subsubsection{VSCode Setup}

Get an installer for your system at
\href{https://code.visualstudio.com/}{code.visualstudio.com}.
Once installed open VSCode and install the Python extension.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extensions can be opened via the toolbar on the left or with Ctrl+Shift+x.
    \item Search for Python in the extensions, first result should be the correct one.
    \item Open settings. Shortcut here is Ctrl+,
    \item On Windows search the settings for the entry
    ``Python: Conda Path'' and set it for your system.\footnote{Will Probably be at\\ \
\verb!D:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\Scripts\conda.exe! }
    \item Onm Linux the Path to Python will probably already be set correctly.
    \item Enable all linters and style checker, that you like.
    \item VSCode will help you with the installation of linters and style checkers,
          if the Python or Conda path ist set correctly.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Linters, Stylecheckers and Formatters}

A Linter is a program, that ``looks'' at your code and warns you about potential
problems with it. These Problems include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Not adhering to a style guide.
    \item Not adhering to conventions.
    \item Your code contains structures that are commonly associated with errors.
    \item Your code contains structures that make it harder to maintain.
    \item Your code contains actual errors, like syntax errors, that would crash it on execution.
\end{itemize}

Popular linters for Python are \href{https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint}{pylint} and
\href{https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes}{pyflakes}.
Pylint is more feature rich than pyflakes.
The ammount of things Pylint checks can be overwhelming but the checks can be limited
via configuration files.

A popular linter specialized on code style, a style checker,
is \href{https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle}{pycodestyle}.
It checks if your code adheres to the Python
\href{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/}{PEP 8} style guide.

Many problems such linters might find, can potentially be fixed automatically.
Black is a formatter, that can fix many style guide violations automatically.
It is an opinionated formatter, meaning that it is not very configurable by design.
Black also tries to format your code in a way to improve git diffs.

There is no ``one'' way to format your code.
PEP 8 was developed by people who were highly involved and experienced in Python.
It is however not the be-all and end-all on how to style your code.
Not adhering to it does not make your code ``wrong''.
But it is a piece of shared knowledge between many Python programmers.
Adhering to and knowing the conventions makes it easier for you to understand
the code of others and your own code after you did not look at it for a long time.

\section{Python compared to other languages}

\subsection{Python compared to R}

\begin{table}[h]

\\\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\section{Pythonsyntax}

Most languages use visible characters to define a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(programming)}{code block}.

A loop in R can look like this:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
for(number in 1:10) {
print(number)
}
\end{lstlisting}

And the same loop can also look like this:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
for(number in 1:10){print(number)}
\end{lstlisting}

Or like this:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
for(number in 1:10) {
    print(number)
}
\end{lstlisting}


The whitespace in the third example carries no syntactical meaning.
But this kind of indention is used by many programmers to make their
code more readable.
It makes it easier for people to determine the block a line of code belongs to.
Python on the other hand uses whitespace explicitly to denote a block.
The same loop in python would look like this:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
for number in range(1, 11):
    print(number)
\end{lstlisting}

Python forces its users to write cleaner looking code through its use of whitespace
as syntactical characters.
As a teaching language it was created with readability of the code in mind.

Python does not care if you use spaces or tab characters as long as it is consistent.
It also does not care how many spaces or tabs are used as long as it is consistent.
As with many scripting languages Python leaves some freedom to its users.
It is however strongly recommended\footnote{
    Python has a Style Guide
\href{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/}{PEP 8}
}
to limit oneself to the use of spaces
and exactly 4 spaces per indentation level.
Adhering to the style guide makes it easier for others (yourself in the future included)
to reuse the code.




\section{Statements and Expressions}
\section{Decisions and Loops}

\subsection{if, elif, else}

Often times we have to handle data differently during computation depending on
the makeup of the data.
Or we have to decide to do certain things if our data is a certain way.

To do this we can make use of the $if$, $if\cdots else$ and $if\cdots elif$
statements:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
if a_variable == 1:
    print("It is one.")
elif a_variable == 2:
    print("It is one.")
else:
    print("It is too much man.")
\end{lstlisting}

If the statement at $if$ evaluates to True ``This is one.'' will be printed.
If it evaluates to False, the $elif$ statement is checked.
An $if$ statement can be followed by an arbitrary amount of $elif$ statements.
Only the one that evaluates to True gets its block executed, all statements
after that will be skipped.
The $else$ block will only be executed if all other checks evaluate to False.

\subsubsection{What is True?}

Obviously boolean $True$ and $False$ values evaluate to what they say.
But in python there are also ``Truthy'' and ``Falsy'' values.
These values are not of the type boolean but will be treated as such in the right context:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
a_list = []

if a_list:
    print("The first element is: " + a_list[0])
else:
    print("The list is empty.")
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
    \item An empty list, dictionary, set, string or a 0 will evaluate to False in a boolean context.
    \item The special $None$ value will also evaluate to False. 
    \item A list, dictionary or set with at least one element will evaluate to True.
    \item All numbers other than 0 and a string with at least one character will also evaluate to True.
\end{itemize}






\section{Data Types, Sequences, Sets and Dictionaries}

The type of a variable is determined by the python interpreter at the time
of execution.
The interpreter can convert values to different types when it is necessary. 

\subsection{Build-in Types}

Python has extensive \href{https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html}{documentation}
on their build-in types. 
The most basic types you will most commonly come in contact with:

\begin{itemize}
    \item integer
    \item float
    \item boolean
    \item string
\end{itemize}

These are immutable, i.e.\@ their value cannot be changed.
Operations performed on them always create completely new ``thing''.
In contrast to them stand mutable types, which can be changed.

\subsection{Lists}\label{lists}

As the name suggests, this is a list of ``things''.
It can contain everything that can also be assigned to a variable.
Lists are mutable. They can be changed.
Elements can be added or removed from a list after it has been created.

Lists can be created empty:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
an_empty_list = list()
another_empty_list = []
\end{lstlisting}

and then be filled:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
list_for_content = an_empty_list
list_for_content.append(1)
# The name of an_empty_list is now a lie.
list_for_content.append(2)
list_for_content.append(3)
\end{lstlisting}

It can also be created with content:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
a_list_with_content = [1 ,2 ,3]
\end{lstlisting}

Elements of a list can be accessed like this:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
a_list_with_content[0]
a_list_with_content[2]
\end{lstlisting}

Indices in Python start at 0, meaning that
$an\_empty\_list[0]$ will be $1$ and $an\_empty\_list[2]$
will be 3.

    }{Here is an executable example.}


\subsubsection{Interlude: Mutability}

As you can see, the list, that was supposed to be empty, is no longer empty.
When passing a mutable object to something else, the value is not passed to it like a mutable type.
Instead a reference to its location in memory is passed.
$an\_empty\_list$ and $list\_for\_content$ pointed to the same reference.
When we added values to $list\_for\_content$, $an\_empty\_list$ also changed, since they
point to the same \textbf{changeable} thing inside the computers memory.

\subsubsection{Slicing}

Slicing gives you an easy and comprehensible way to get a part of a list.
Slicing a list looks similar to addressing a single element:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
# The range() function is useful for the creation of numerical sequences.
n_up_to_a_hundred = list(range(1,101))
n_up_to_50 = n_up_to_a_hundred[:50]
multiples_of_two_up_to_50 = n_up_to_a_hundred[1:50:2]
\end{lstlisting}
The numbers between the brackets provide [first index:last index:step]


\subsubsection{List comprehension}

List comprehension, somewhat like slicing, lets us create a list from another list.
Slicing only allows us to select elements from a list by index.
List comprehension is far more powerful.

\subsection{Dictionaries}

A dictionary is similar to what is called hash map or hash table in other languages.
It is a collection of values, that can be accessed by keys.
A key can be anything that is immutable.
Similar to a real life dictionary, if you know the name of something, you can look up
information about that thing inside a Python dictionary.
Dictionary values can be accessed like lists with angular braces $[]$.
But instead of passing an index a key is passed to the dictionary.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
CLASS_AGE = {
    "Anne": 27,
    "John": 25,
    "Marie": 24,
    "Dan": 30,
}

if CLASS_AGE["John"] == 25:
    print("John is 25")
\end{lstlisting}

\href{http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html\#code=CLASS\_AGE\%20\%3D\%20\%7B\%0A\%20\%20\%20\%20\%22Anne\%22\%3A\%2027,\%0A\%20\%20\%20\%20\%22John\%22\%3A\%2025,\%0A\%20\%20\%20\%20\%22Marie\%22\%3A\%2024,\%0A\%20\%20\%20\%20\%22Dan\%22\%3A\%2030,\%0A\%7D\%0A\%0A\%23\%20This\%20is\%20True\%0Aif\%20CLASS\_AGE\%5B\%22John\%22\%5D\%20\%3D\%3D\%2025\%3A\%0A\%20\%20\%20\%20print\%28\%22John\%20is\%2025\%22\%29\%0A\%20\%20\%20\%20\%0Afor\%20key,\%20value\%20in\%20CLASS\_AGE.items\%28\%29\%3A\%0A\%20\%20\%20\%20print\%28f\%22\%7Bkey\%7D\%20is\%20\%7Bvalue\%7D\%20years\%20old.\%22\%29\&cumulative=false\&curInstr=15\&heapPrimitives=nevernest\&mode=display\&origin=opt-frontend.js\&py=3\&rawInputLstJSON=\%5B\%5D\&textReferences=false}
{Interactive example at pythontutor.com}

\subsubsection{Dictionary Comprehension}

Like list comprehension for dictionaries.
Is done in curly brackets like a dictionary declaration.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
# index % 2 == 1 would be more readable but did not fit on a line.
even_odd_mapping = {
    index: "odd" if index % 2 else "even" for index in range(10)
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Sets}

A set is a list of values where no duplicates are possible.
If a value is added twice to a set, it is not added to the set again.
This is done through similar mechanisms\footnote{
    Called \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function}{hashing}
}, that are used for the linking of keys to values dictionaries.
Which means that like dictionary keys, set values have to be immutable.

\subsection{Tuple}

A tuple is a list of values.
It is, in contrast to the normal list type, immutable
Once set, a tuple cannot be changed.
This means that tuple, that only contain immutable values, can be dictionary keys.

\section{Functions}

A function is a code structure, that accepts some form of input, does something
and returns a value.



\section{Generators and Iterators}\label{generators}
\section{Classes and Objects}
\section{Dealing with Errors}

\subsection{Tracebacks}

A traceback is returned by python if an exception is raised unhandled.
It includes the function calls leading up to the position where the error was raised.
Tracebacks are very useful to locate errors in your code.

\begin{figure}[h]
