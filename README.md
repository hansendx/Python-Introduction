# Learning Resources

- [realpython - OOP](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/)
- [realpython - testing](https://realpython.com/python-testing/)

  * Has some free text based tutorials.

- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

  * Has several courses to learn languages.
  * Exercises are done directly inside the browser and are accompanied with
    learning material.
  * They have a subscription based membership but their basic Python course seems to
    still be free.

- [exercism](https://exercism.io/)

  * Has a collection of programming exercises with varying difficulty levels.
  * The exercises are done locally on your machine
  * Exercises can be down and uploaded through their [cli](https://exercism.io/cli)
  * You can work on your own or let mentors(i.e. a real person) comment on your code.
  * The exercises come with tests to check if your code function as intended which
    is a nice way to get a look at how tests work in a language.
  * Note (April 29): Mentors may currently need more time to comment since
    they seem to work on a new version of exercism.

- [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)

  * Collection of programming challenges, from beginners to professional.
  * Has a challenge aspect
    where your solution stands against the solution of other community members.
